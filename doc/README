This is a quick post on getting started using the txAMQP library with RabbitMQ.

Install RabbitMQ
	
If you're using Debian (or a derivative, like Ubuntu) and RabbitMQ is not
included in your distribution, you can add RabbitMQ's APT repository:

http://www.rabbitmq.com/debian.html#apt

Running RabbitMQ

If you installed RabbitMQ using the Debian package, it will be automatically
started. If not, you'll find an init.d file in /etc/init.d/rabbitmq-server

Install Twisted

As of 2009-09-07, txAMQP is being developed using Twisted 8.2.0, it may
work with older versions, but it's guaranteed. In case you are using
Ubuntu, and the version available is not that recent, you can install
Twisted through our PPA:

# TODO move these packages to Twisted's PPA

Install txAMQP

The instructions below install txAQMP from trunk. There are Ubuntu packages available
if you prefer, refer to the following for more details:
